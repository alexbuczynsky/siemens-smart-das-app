_Copyright (C) 2017 Siemens AG_

This license serves the purpose to facilitate exchange of source
code among Siemens Affiliates on an internal
code sharing platform. It applies to Siemens AG and all Siemens
Affiliates (defined as companies in which Siemens AG holds at
least 50% of the shares or exercises control) that are either
participating in the Cost Contribution Agreement (“CCA”) or are
entitled to participate by other agreements (hereinafter referred
to as “Participating Siemens Entity”).

Each Participating Siemens Entity grants to all other
Participating Siemens Entities a non-exclusive, perpetual and
irrevocable right and license to make use of the software and the
associated documentation files that it has developed and expressly
designated as an Inner Source project (hereinafter “SOFTWARE”),
subject to compliance with the following terms.  Each
Participating Siemens Entity is entitled to:

* copy, modify, merge, sublicense, distribute, publish and make
  available the SOFTWARE in source-code and binary form for internal
  purposes; and

* copy, sublicense, publish, distribute and make available the
  SOFTWARE in binary form only to a third party (e.g. a SIEMENS
  customer), subject to these restrictions:

  * a) The entity may not grant any exclusive rights to the SOFTWARE
    to any third party; and

  * b) The entity must observe all restrictions and/or guidelines and
    the optional [RESTRICTIONS.md](RESTRICTIONS.md) file of the relevant inner source
    project; and

  * c) The entity must license the SOFTWARE to third parties under
    license terms that do not contradict the terms of this license,
    the CCA and/or any other applicable agreement that entitles the
    entity to participate; and

  * d) The entity must hold responsibility for the use of the
    SOFTWARE towards any third party (e.g. a Siemens customer), and
    not raise warranty or damage claims for faults in the SOFTWARE
    under ZRG (as ZRG require a customer/supplier relationship and
    code-sharing is a combination of both).

Each Participating Siemens Entity must make available all versions
of the SOFTWARE on the Siemens Inner Source Code Repository
platform in source code form under this License in its then
current version.
